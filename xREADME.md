## Tips and Notes

*Do not hotlink any images from the internet. If you wish to add and use an image, place it somewhere inside the `/img` folder, use it in your code, and add it with your commit.*

You can preview your changes by opening the `/index.html` file on your browser. You might need to flush your browser cache to see your updated changes.

After you commit your new changes, it will take a few minutes for the site to reflect the new changes. Make sure to flush your browser cache so your browser gets the new version of the website.

Have fun!
